<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction<a href="#Menu">Menu</a></h2>

<p>SixOrNot is a Firefox extension intended to make it easy for you to identify when the website you're connecting to supports the current generation Internet Protocol (version 6). It does this by checking the site's DNS records and displaying an icon either in the address bar or as a button (which you may place anywhere buttons can usually be placed in Firefox). This icon indicates whether the site you are viewing supports IPv6 (or only the legacy Internet Protocol, IPv4). SixOrNot looks at each connection Firefox makes and notes whether it was made using IPv4 or IPv6, the information is then displayed via a handy tooltip. SixOrNot also tries to detect the IP addresses of your local machine for informational display.</p>

<h2><a name="Installation"></a>Installation<a href="#Menu">Menu</a></h2>

<p>Installation is via the usual Firefox method, simply download the .xpi format attachment and accept when prompted to install. SixOrNot is a "restartless" or "bootstrapped" extension - this means you don't need to restart Firefox when it is installed and you should see the addressbar icon appear immediately upon installation. The button can be dragged from the "Customize..." interface to wherever you desire.</p>

<p>Upgrading should be similarly easy and handled automatically by the addons interface.</p>

<h2><a name="Interface"></a>Interface<a href="#Menu">Menu</a></h2>

<p>The SixOrNot interface is fairly simple. An icon is displayed either in the address bar near the star icon or as a button. By default the address bar icon is disabled and the button is placed onto the navigation bar. You can move the button anywhere you like by entering the Firefox UI customisation mode and simply dragging it to the desired location. Whether accessed through the button or address bar icon the functionality is identical. Upon clicking the button/icon a tooltip panel is displayed which shows information about the site you are connecting to.</p>

<p>The main site is displayed first, in bold text. The first IP address entry is the actual address used to connect, the remaining addresses are those retrieved from DNS records for the domain in question. Subsequent entries in the list are for domains which additional resources have been loaded from, e.g. images from content delivery networks. Again, the first address is the actual connection, the rest are from DNS. You can click on the [+XX] link to expand DNS information for the secondary connections. The number to the left of the domain indicates the total number of connections made to it for this page.</p>

    <h3><a name="Interface_Icons"></a>Icon Meanings<a href="#Interface">Interface</a></h3>

    <p>The IP addressing state of each domain is displayed via a set of icons, their meanings are outlined below. Note that there are two sets of icons to choose between (one colourful, the other greyscale). The grey icons look nicer when used with the button on Mac OSX for example, and can be better for those who have difficulty distinguishing between colours.</p>

    <ul class="icon_list">
    <li class="i_other">This icon can mean a variety of things, generally it indicates that no IP address information exists for the current location or that there was a failure obtaining it. Try navigating to a website and ensuring you are not using a Proxy and that Offline mode isn't enabled.</li>
    <li class="i_6only">This icon indicates that Firefox connected to this domain using IPv6 and only AAAA (IPv6) records were found for the domain in DNS. This generally means that the domain in question only supports IPv6. For example: <a href="http://ipv6.entropy.me.uk">ipv6.entropy.me.uk</a>.</li>
    <li class="i_6and4">This icon indicates that Firefox connected to this domain using IPv6 and both AAAA (IPv6) and A (IPv4) records were found for the domain in DNS. For example: <a href="http://entropy.me.uk">entropy.me.uk</a>.</li>
    <li class="i_4pot6">This icon indicates that Firefox connected to this domain using IPv4 and both AAAA (IPv6) and A (IPv4) records were found for the current domain. While the remote domain does support IPv6 your browser did not use it to connect.</li>
    <li class="i_4only">This icon indicates that Firefox connected to this domain using IPv4 and only A (IPv4) records were returned for the domain. Either your DNS is not capable of returning AAAA records or (more likely) the domain in question supports only the legacy version of the Internet Protocol suite. Why not ask why they haven't upgraded yet? An example can be found here: <a href="http://ipv4.entropy.me.uk">ipv4.entropy.me.uk</a></li>
    <li class="i_6only_cache">This icon indicates that Firefox retrieved all objects in the current page from this domain from local cache (no external connections were made). Only AAAA (IPv6) records were found for this domain in DNS, indicating that the domain is probably available only via IPv6.</li>
    <li class="i_4pot6_cache">This icon indicates that Firefox retrieved all objects in the current page from this domain from local cache (no external connections were made). Both AAAA (IPv6) and A (IPv4) records were found for this domain in DNS, indicating that the domain is IPv6 capable.</li>
    <li class="i_4only_cache">This icon indicates that Firefox retrieved all objects in the current page from this domain from local cache (no external connections were made). Only A (IPv4) records were found for this domain in DNS, indicating that the domain is probably available only via IPv4.</li>
    <li class="i_proxy">This icon indicates that Firefox is currently configured to use a proxy. This prevents SixOrNot from detecting IP address information for the connection automatically and prevents DNS lookups.</li>
    <li class="i_error">This icon indicates an error occurred for the domain in question.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="Interface_Warnings"></a>Interface Warnings<a href="#Interface">Interface</a></h3>

    <p>SixOrNot may display warnings in red text on the tooltip. More detailed explanations of these warnings can be found here.</p>

    <ul>
    <li><span class="red">Warning: Firefox IPv6 DNS lookups disabled!</span><br />This warning indicates that the Firefox preferences setting "network.dns.disableIPv6" has been set to true. This means that Firefox won't itself lookup IPv6 addresses for any of the domains you visit. Typically there's very little reason to enable this setting. SixOrNot usually uses a different mechanism to lookup DNS records so it will probably still find IPv6 addresses for domains even when this setting is enabled (though it will never display the Green icon in this case). For more information about this Firefox setting see the <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Network.dns.disableIPv6">Mozilla Documentation</a>.</li>
    <li><span class="red">Warning: Domain is in ipv4OnlyDomains list!</span><br />This warning indicates that the domain you are currently visiting is listed in the "network.dns.ipv4OnlyDomains" setting. This means that Firefox will never attempt to connect using IPv6 to this website, even if it has AAAA records in DNS and your own machine has IPv6 connectivity. SixOrNot will never display the Green icon for these sites but will still show the IPv6 addresses if they are found. More information about this Firefox setting can be found on the <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Network.dns.ipv4OnlyDomains">Mozilla Documentation</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="Interface_Settings"></a>Configurable Settings<a href="#Interface">Interface</a></h3>

    <p>SixOrNot allows you to configure the following settings.</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Whether or not the address bar icon should be displayed. This is either on or off. This can be configured via the menu either by clicking on the address bar icon or the button. If you turn the address bar icon off and don't see the button try opening the button palette via the standard right-click+"Customise" functionality in Firefox. You can drag the address bar icon from there to anywhere you like on the UI. Note: If you want the address bar icon back you need to switch it on via the button's menu. You can always remove the button again afterwards by dragging it back to the button palette.</li>
    <li>Whether to use the colourful icon set or the greyscale one. This can be switched via either menu at any time. The grey icons don't look quite as good except when being used on Mac OSX with the button (where most buttons are greyscale). They are also good for those with specific accessibility needs where colours aren't a sufficient means of communicating information.</li>
    <li>Whether to display non-global IP addresses. By default SixOrNot does not show you IP addresses which would not normally be used to connect to remote websites, e.g. linklocal addresses. If you want to see these in the UI then enable this option.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>These options can also be configured via the following boolean values in "about:config":</p>

    <pre>extensions.sixornot.showaddressicon</pre>
    <pre>extensions.sixornot.greyscaleicons</pre>
    <pre>extensions.sixornot.showallips</pre>

    <p>The other extensions.sixornot settings should not generally be changed manually.</p>

<h2><a name="OSSpecific"></a>Operating System specific information<a href="#Menu">Menu</a></h2>

<p>Due to the use of OS native DNS resolution and local address detection SixOrNot can behave differently on different operating systems running Firefox. Additionally support for IPv6 varies between OSes and some special steps are needed to enable it in some cases. See below for information on your OS.</p>

    <h3><a name="OSSpecific_OSX"></a>Mac OSX<a href="#OSSpecific">Operating System specific information</a></h3>

    <p>SixOrNot is fully compatible with OSX 10.6 and 10.7. IPv6 is enabled by default in these versions of the operating system and no special configuration should be needed for full functionality. I have not tested SixOrNot with earlier versions of OSX so if you encounter problems please do let me know.</p>

    <h3><a name="OSSpecific_Windows7Vista"></a>Windows 7/Windows Vista<a href="#OSSpecific">Operating System specific information</a></h3>

    <p>SixOrNot is fully compatible with Windows 7 and Windows Vista SP2.</p>

    <h3><a name="OSSpecific_Windows2003"></a>Windows XP x64/Windows Server 2003<a href="#OSSpecific">Operating System specific information</a></h3>

    <p>SixOrNot is fully compatible with Windows XP x64 and Windows Server 2003 (x86 and x64). On all these operating systems IPv6 must be manually installed. This can be done by using the command:</p>

    <pre>netsh interface ipv6 install</pre>

    <p>The interface will then autoconfigure an IPv6 address, or, if autoconfiguration can't work for some reason manual configuration will be needed. See this Microsoft article for more information on configuring IPv6 in Windows XP x64/Windows Server 2003: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/325449">How to install and configure IP version 6 in Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Server</a>.</p>

    <p>Please note: If the Windows XP x64/Windows Server 2003 IPv6 support has not been installed via the above command then SixOrNot will not be able to detect IPv6 addresses of remote websites. There is currently no way around this limitation.</p>

    <h3><a name="OSSpecific_WindowsXPx86"></a>Windows XP x86<a href="#OSSpecific">Operating System specific information</a></h3>

    <p>Windows XP x86 supports IPv6 from SP2, however SixOrNot only supports Windows XP x86 SP3. On Windows XP x86 SP3 IPv6 needs to be manually installed. This can be done by using the command:</p>

    <pre>netsh interface ipv6 install</pre>

    <p>The interface will then autoconfigure an IPv6 address, or, if autoconfiguration can't work for some reason manual configuration will be needed. See this Microsoft article for more information on configuring IPv6 in Windows XP x86: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/sag_ip_v6_imp_config_meth.mspx?mfr=true">IPv6 configuration methods</a>.</p>

    <p>Please note: If the Windows XP x86 IPv6 support has not been installed via the above command then SixOrNot will not be able to detect IPv6 addresses of remote websites. There is currently no way around this limitation.</p>

    <h3><a name="OSSpecific_Linux"></a>Linux<a href="#OSSpecific">Operating System specific information</a></h3>

    <p>SixOrNot has currently only been tested under Ubuntu Linux (version 11.04). It should work on any distribution however. If you are experiencing problems with SixOrNot on a Linux distribution other than this please get in touch with me and I'll try to fix it for your distribution.</p>

<h2><a name="IPConcepts"></a>IP Address Concepts<a href="#Menu">Menu</a></h2>

<p>IP addresses are fundamental to the operation of the Internet, billions of people use millions of them every day and yet they are invisible in day-to-day use. Usually we don't need to care about IP addresses and in most cases one only becomes aware of them when something is broken. This is due to a system called DNS - the Domain Name System. This masks the technical complexity of addressing behind easy-to-remember domain names. When you visit a website behind the scenes the domain name of that website (everything between the "http://" and the first "/") is looked up via a DNS query to produce an IP address. These addresses are then used to determine how to communicate with the server responsible for serving that website.</p>

<p>There are currently two flavours of IP address around because the Internet is going through a migration period from the old way of addressing things (known as Internet Protocol version 4, or IPv4) to a new addressing system (known as Internet Protocol version 6, or IPv6). The main difference is the number of addresses available, though this is by far the most important difference. IPv4 addresses are represented as 32-bit numbers, the largest number which can be represented in this way is 2^32 (2 to the power of 32) or 4,294,967,296. That sounds like a lot but we are rapidly running out of them (and in practice we can't even use all of those). IPv6 addresses are represented by 128-bit numbers, the largest number which can be represented in this way is 2^128 (2 to the power of 128) or 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 (that's approximately 340 billion billion billion billion, or 3.4x10^38).</p>

<p>So why is there a problem? Adoption of the current IP addressing standard (IPv6) has been slow. Most traffic on the Internet still uses the legacy addressing scheme. At the time of writing less than 1% of all Internet traffic uses IPv6. Given the impending exhaustion of IPv4 addresses (at the time of writing the Asia-Pacific regional registry, APNIC, has already run out) this is a major problem facing the Internet community. The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 isn't an easy one and involves a lot of work, this is typically work which goes unnoticed to the end user. This is as it should be and for the vast majority of people IP addressing will continue to remain an invisible part of their Internet-using experience. The flip side of this invisibility however is that it's easy to overlook the pioneers who are already using IPv6 and raise awareness among those that are not. I am hopeful that by exposing the IP version being used as part of your web browsing this extension will help make it just a little bit more visible.</p>
