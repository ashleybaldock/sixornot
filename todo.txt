# TODO

Update documentation (pretty much completely)


# 0.7.5
Warnings for ip6_disabled and ip4only_domain
Add settings to panel, since we can't link to about:addons easily

# TODO FUTURE
Add back local address display refresh on tooltip show
Handling for edge-cases and special pages (text)
Add ability to copy a list of all files fetched to clipboard (per-domain)
Add better proxy detection (per-connection) and icon display
 Use: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XPCOM_Interface_Reference/nsIProtocolProxyService
 Same way that DNS lookups are done, with a callback
Platform-specific text colours for optimal display on panel
Preferences override for all text display colours (if not set use platform-specific)
Proper website landing page + download links
Native resolver compatibility with FreeBSD

# TODO Future
Preference to set whether icon should come before or after the star icon
Remote mode - simple check of local->remote IPv6 connectivity by requesting a page from a webservice
E.g. ipv6.sixornot.com/ipv4.sixornot.com
This will be optional (and off by default)
Needs update to privacy policy etc., state that aggregate statistics may be gathered but no personally identifiable information sent
Also state that no details of the sites you visit are sent
Also add external address detection via external server??
