# TODO


# Known bugs:
On Australis, changing the greyscale setting while the button is not displayed
results in the button not conforming to the setting


# 2.0.0
E10S support                                                                - DONE
Use Services.jsm in place of Components.classes.getService where possible   - DONE
 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Services.jsm
Replace env.jsm with Services.jsm.appinfo                                   - DONE
Refactor requestcache/requestobserver
 - Unify host listing object with local host listing object
 - Better end-to-end management of host entries including creation
 - Accessor methods for cache/waitinglist                                   - DONE
 - Move methods to destroy entries into requests object                     - DONE
 - Abstract implementation of cache - maybe change from an array            - DONE
Optimise panel + other code                                                 - DONE
 - Avoid lengthy IP type/ordering calls
 - Avoid adding entries to panel until they are displayed                   - DONE
 - Refactor UI to split out legacy components & freeze                      - DONE
    - Test legacy UI
 - Refactor locale handling code to use built-in functionality              - DONE

SSL information for connections
 - Show padlock icon for each host                                          - DONE
 - Certificate info on hover over icon (+ copy to clipboard on click)

split MM from widget/panel into object for code reuse                       - DONE
 - maybe update panel via widget?
unload for content script
jslint validation
Update documentation
test on non-E10S (determine min version)
test on legacy platforms
 - SeaMonkey                                            - Seems working
 - FF ESR
integrate documentation into addon instead of online
observe showallips preference and update panel
look into http-on-examine-merged-response
investigate channelIsForDownload on nsIHttpChannelInternal


#2.1
NAT64 prefixes
 - Detection + conversion of embedded IPv4 addresses
 - Configurable prefix
 - Autodetect prefixes (+ manual config too)
 - Translation strings for config

Warnings for ip6_disabled and ip4only_domain
 - ip4only_domain should show a badge next to affected domains
    - permit toggling whether a domain is on the ip4 only list or not
 - ip6_disabled should show a warning on the panel
    - maybe tint the entire panel red?

Proxy detection + info
Add better proxy detection (per-connection) and icon display
 Use: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XPCOM_Interface_Reference/nsIProtocolProxyService
 Same way that DNS lookups are done, with a callback
Disable native DNS resolution for proxied connections

SSL information for connections
 (- Show yellow icon for mixed-mode connections)


# 2.2
Overview mode for icon 
 - show green icon only if all connections made using v6
 - show blue icon only if all hosts have only AAAA records

Local info:
Retrieve interface information along with addresses
 - Display local addresses per interface

Retrieve netmask information for each address and display (e.g. 1999::1/64)
 - Also collect tunnel interface IPs on Vista+

Better greyscale icons (especially for cache entries)


# Rejected ideas:

show http/https/mixed info
Detail view pane for info about each connection
Copy everything (report) to clipboard
Add ability to copy a list of all files fetched to clipboard (per-domain)
Record total size of objects downloaded from each site + display (in KB? etc.)
Icon display in status bar on SeaMonkey/Firefox alternatives
switch over to nsIWebProgressListener - doesn't expose IP addresses!


# Ideas

Multiple workers to speed up DNS resolution
Refactor return objects from DNS lookups (wrapped IP address objects w/ type etc.)

Test internationalised domain names handling by native resolvers
 - e.g. www.söhne.com

Collect nsIHttpChannelInternal.localAddress info for each request
 - Highlight addresses used to load pages?

German translation for addon description

Handling for edge-cases and special pages (text)
Reverse DNS lookups? (local/remote)
More info about IP address types, e.g. link-local, global etc.
