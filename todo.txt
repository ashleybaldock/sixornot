#2.1
investigate channelIsForDownload on nsIHttpChannelInternal
test on legacy platforms
 - SeaMonkey                                            - Seems working
 - FF ESR
    - Test legacy UI
Optimisations
 - Avoid lengthy IP type/ordering calls

NAT64 prefixes
 - Detection + conversion of embedded IPv4 addresses
 - Configurable prefix
 - Autodetect prefixes (+ manual config too)
 - Translation strings for config

Warnings for ip6_disabled and ip4only_domain
 - ip4only_domain should show a badge next to affected domains
    - permit toggling whether a domain is on the ip4 only list or not
 - ip6_disabled should show a warning on the panel
    - maybe tint the entire panel red?


SSL information for connections
 (- Show yellow icon for mixed-mode connections)
 - Certificate info on hover over icon (+ copy to clipboard on click)


# 2.2
Overview mode for icon 
 - show green icon only if all connections made using v6
 - show blue icon only if all hosts have only AAAA records

Local info:
Refactor local address code
Retrieve interface information along with addresses
 - Display local addresses per interface
 - Linting ctypes files

Retrieve netmask information for each address and display (e.g. 1999::1/64)
 - Also collect tunnel interface IPs on Vista+

Better greyscale icons (especially for cache entries)
 - new monochrome icon set (match new FF icons?)


# Rejected ideas:

Detail view pane for info about each connection
Copy everything (report) to clipboard
Add ability to copy a list of all files fetched to clipboard (per-domain)
Record total size of objects downloaded from each site + display (in KB? etc.)
Icon display in status bar on SeaMonkey/Firefox alternatives
switch over to nsIWebProgressListener - doesn't expose IP addresses!


# Ideas

Multiple workers to speed up DNS resolution
Refactor return objects from DNS lookups (wrapped IP address objects w/ type etc.)

Test internationalised domain names handling by native resolvers
 - e.g. www.s√∂hne.com

Collect nsIHttpChannelInternal.localAddress info for each request
 - Highlight addresses used to load pages?

German translation for addon description

Handling for edge-cases and special pages (text)
Reverse DNS lookups? (local/remote)
More info about IP address types, e.g. link-local, global etc.
